# Adversarial Shadow Attack on Traffic Sign Sequences

This project introduces a **non-differentiable adversarial shadow attack** designed to target **traffic sign recognition models** over entire **image sequences**. Leveraging a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**, the attack strategically overlays realistic shadow patterns that evolve over time‚Äîmimicking the appearance of cast shadows in dynamic driving scenarios.

### üîç Key Features

- **Sequence-Level Attack:** Operates over temporally ordered image sequences, simulating how a sign is seen from different distances.
- **Shadow Generator:** Applies photorealistic shadow perturbations using parametric masks (polygon or triangle) in LAB color space.
- **Temporal Consistency:** A single shadow shape and opacity is applied across the sequence with gradual spatial scaling to mimic real-world dynamics.
- **Multi-Objective Loss:** Jointly optimizes classification confidence and attention consistency using ViT attention maps from DINO.
- **Black-Box Optimization:** Uses a genetic algorithm to evolve adversarial shadow parameters without access to model gradients.

### üì¶ Components

- `main.py`: Orchestrates the end-to-end attack pipeline.
- `shadow_attack.py`: Implements the GA-based shadow optimization logic.
- `shadow_generator.py`: Generates physically plausible shadow masks.
- `GTSRBClassifier.py`: Loads and evaluates the GTSRB CNN classifier.
- `dino_attention.py`: Extracts DINO ViT attention maps.
- `compute_l2_shadow_diff.py`: Calculates L2 distance between clean and adversarial images for stealthiness evaluation.

### üìä Evaluation

- **Attack Success Rate (ASR):** Measures misclassification over sequences.
- **Attention Shift (MSE):** Quantifies deviation from original attention maps.
- **L2 Distance:** Assesses perceptual difference between clean and shadowed images.

### üìÅ Dataset

- Based on [GTSRB](https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html), preprocessed into sequences of 30 RGB frames per traffic sign, with tight bounding box crops.
